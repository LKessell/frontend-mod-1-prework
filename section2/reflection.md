## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to be a little uncomfortable asking for help, and often wait too long before asking a question. I am making an effort to work on this, and not spend too much time being stuck without progress before asking a question!

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I feel like this section was a good step up in difficulty! It was good practice to not have the solution readily available, but it wasn't difficult to find answers. Googling how to accomplish coding tasks is going to be vital, so this was a good intro. I enjoyed getting information from multiple outside sources as I felt it was helpful to see the concepts explained in different ways. It gave me a more clear understanding of the material.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statements deal with situations in an if/then/else format. A daily life example would be if you are very hungry, eat a meal. If you're a little hungry, eat a snack. Otherwise, don't eat anything.  
On a website, a conditional statement could be used when a user logs in to their account. If the username and password entered are correct, the user is logged in. otherwise, an error message is displayed.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

`else if` is used to add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, but they will only execute a code block if their condition evaluates to `true`. They must also be chained to a previous `if` statement, they cannot be the first condition.  
The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code when none of the previous `if` statements evaluate to `true`.  
The program evaluates each statement sequentially. If the first condition evaluates to `true`, its corresponding code block is run. If it evaluates to `false`, the next statement is evaluated. This process continues until one of the code blocks is run, and that block will only run once. Any additional statements after the one which runs its code block will not be evaluated.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

These are the logical AND `&&` and OR `||` operators. The `&&` operator returns `true` when both of its operands are true, and `false` in other cases. This could be used to determine if two conditions are met. The `||` operator returns `false` when both of its operands are `false`, but otherwise returns `true`. This operator could be used to determine if at least one of its conditions is met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

What is the difference between `!=` and `!==`?  
Is there a limit on the number of parameters that a function can have?  
The 'Introduction to JavaScript' article showed several different ways to write functions. Are there specific uses for each syntax method?
