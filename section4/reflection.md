## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?  
I often end up working for longer periods of time without taking breaks, and I sort of expected to be more distracted by taking breaks more often, but I didn't find this to be the case! I felt very focused, and was eager to get back to work after my break, rather than feeling distracted. I also felt that having a longer break after four Pomodoro "blocks" was a good balance of time working vs. rest. I think I will continue to tweak the timing, but I found this method very effective.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?  
I felt that I was surprisingly efficient in my work for this section. I was able to accomplish more tasks during each block than I anticipated, and I never felt "burnt-out" while working. I think it will take some more practice to get better at estimating the amount of time for tasks, so I'm going to continue experimenting with the Pomodoro method as I work on more practice tasks for Mod 1.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?  
An object is similar to an array in that it is a single variable that holds multiple pieces of information. Unlike an array, however, the data in an object is arranged in key-value pairs. The key is like a label for its corresponding value. Like an array, the values in the key-value pairs can be any data type. Objects can store more complex data than an array because the data can be accessed using the keys.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: **Array**; Each student would be represented by a single string (Ex. "Jill Smith")
  * List of states and their capitals: **Object**; An object would be a good choice because both the state name and its corresponding capital are being stored.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: **Array**; This is a simple list of items, so an array would be best
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: **Array**; This is another list of single pieces of data, so an array is a good choice
  * List of student names and their cohort: **Object**; An object would be a good choice because you are storing both the student names and their corresponding cohort.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: **Object**; This data would be best stored in an object because both the ingredient types and amounts of each ingredient are being stored.
  * All my favorite restaurants: **Array**; A list of restaurants would be best stored in an array because it is a simple list of items

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?  
An example of an Object on DoorDash could be the user's shopping cart.  
Example keys and values:  
orderTotal: "$19.94"  
items: ["chicken fried rice", "pan-fried dumplings", "pork eggroll"]  
dashPassActive: true   
couponApplied: false  
deliveryEstimate: "27-34 minutes"

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?  
I would like to know more about naming conventions for arguments vs. parameters.  
Typically in a loop, i is assigned a value of 0 or 1 and the loop increments upwards. Are there specific situations where you would want to do the opposite and increment downwards from a higher number?  
While googling a problem, I read that you should avoid reassigning values in JavaScript when possible, is this true?
