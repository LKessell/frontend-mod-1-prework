## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  
The SuperLearner article provided some good advice about maximizing learning. I already recognize the value of teaching as
a learning skill, make an effort to have a varied and healthful diet, and take breaks while working.  
I read a little, but I could benefit from reading more often! I think that I could also improve on having a growth mindset
and viewing learning as a process; I can tend to get impatient.  
I would add that getting a proper amount of quality sleep is a vital part of learning and retaining new information.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.  
String: The data type that represents text. Wrapped in single or double quotes, but the choice should be consistent.  
Strings can contain any type of text, including letters, numbers and special characters.  
`var myString = "Hello, I am a string!";`

Number: Very straightforward, they are numbers! Can be whole numbers, negative numbers, and decimals.  
`var hoursOfHomework = 2;`

Boolean: This data type has only two values, true or false. Booleans are useful for yes/no questions.  
`var isSleepy = false;`

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?  
`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?  
```
// This is a single-line code comment
/*This is also a comment, which can span single or multiple lines*/
```
Code comments allow written notes to be made in the code. Comments can also be used to temporarily disable sections of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?  
A variable is a piece of information stored by the computer. Its value can be changed, and it can be used in multiple places.  
A variable is like a small box. We can put a name on the box, and put a toy inside it. If we want to put a new toy
inside the box, the new toy will push the old toy out of the box.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?  
I use DoorDash more than I should! Some possible variables are:
```
restaurantName = "String";
dashPassActive = Boolean;
itemsInCart = Number;
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.  
Concatenation combines multiple separate strings into one single string. Variables with string or number values can
be combined with other strings to form phrases or sentences.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?  
Using DoorDash as an example, concatenation could be used to display the user's name, the names of restaurants,
or displaying the order total on a confirmation page.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)  
Are there any specific conventions for using concatenation vs. interpolation?  
Does type coercion only work for numbers?  
Are there any conventions for choosing single vs. double quotes for strings?
