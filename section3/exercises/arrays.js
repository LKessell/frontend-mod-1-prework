//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

// animals[animals.length - 1] = "Gorilla";
// If I run this code right now, the string "Elephant" will be reassigned,
// and then it cannot be logged in the last question

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = "Lizard";

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["sushi", "raspberry", "chili", "bread"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.unshift("orange", "meatball", "cookie");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: DoorDash storing items in an order
// 2: Netflix having genre categories of movies/shows
// 3: YouTube storing videos that the used has marked "watch later"

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 16;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

// In this line, the code will evaluate whether the value of percentBatteryLeft
// is greater than or equal to 15
// Since an uber can be called with enough battery regardless of the type or
// presence of a charger, I made this the first evaluation
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  // If that evaluation returns true, "I can call an uber" will be logged to the console
  console.log ("I can call an uber");
  // This line adds an additional condition and evaluates whether hasCharger = true
  // AND chargerType == "car" using the logical operator &&;
} else if (hasCharger && chargerType == "car") {
  // "I can call an uber" will be logged to the console only if hasCharger = true
  // AND chargerType == "car"
  // Special note: must use chargerType == "car" or chargerType === "car"
  // chargerType = "car" is reassigning a variable, NOT a conditional statement!
  console.log("I can call an uber");
  // This line of code will run only when the preceding conditions evaulate false
} else {
  // If none of the conditions return true, "I cannot call an uber :("
  // will be logged to the console
  console.log("I cannot call an uber :(")
}

// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
