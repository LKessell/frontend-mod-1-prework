## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  
+ I found the idea of the Zone of Proximal Development very interesting, where you are presented with a challenge that is slightly outside of your current level of mastery, but not overwhelmingly difficult or impossible. In this way, there is a little bit of struggle and 'figuring out' to accomplish the task, but it can still be done. This seems to be very in-line with Turing's teaching values, and I could really relate to the idea that having to work a little extra on solving a problem really helps when learning something new. Having a proper amount of challenge is important!  
+ One of the concepts from the video interview that stuck out to me was becoming more aware of how you approach struggling, and having a mindset of "What am I struggling with, and how can I fix it?" This is a mindset that I am going to take to heart as I begin my Turing journey, because I know that I can sometimes "panic" in the face of difficulty. Learning to take a step back and say "What do I need to practice?" and then moving forward will help me be more successful.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  
I know that my skills can be improved with practice, and that asking for help is an important part of the learning process. One of the main ways that I would like to improve my mindset is learning not to panic when presented with difficult challenges. I can also hesitate to ask for help in a timely manner, so I know that I need to do a better job of recognizing when I am not making any progress and it's time to reach out! I am definitely a perfectionist, so my biggest struggle will be learning to take a step back and focus on ways to practice and improve when the going gets tough.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.  
I order a lot of DoorDash, and there are lots of areas where Arrays might be used. Each restaurant has a unique menu with unique items available to order, so those items could be stored in an Array. An Array could also be used for the user's shopping cart; having a separate Array for items that the user intends to order.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.  
Array methods are behaviors or actions that can be taken on an Array or the elements contained within it. For example, elements within the Array can be added, removed, or changed. Arrays methods can split arrays into pieces or combine separate Arrays into one. Array methods can also tell us information about the array, such as the number of elements it contains.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?  
Loops allow us to run a code block multiple times according to a condition set by the user. We might use a loop in conjunction with an array if we wanted to perform a specific action on each element in the array, or in specific elements of the array. We might use a loop on its own when we want to run a block of code a specific number of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?  
I really liked the diagram in the textbook that showed loops as literal loops on the page, I would draw this for sure. When making a loop, we tell it when to start, when to make another loop (or how many loops to make), and how to move from the start to the end. After each loop, we have to decide if we can make another loop. The answer could be yes or no depending on how many loops we have chosen to make. If the answer is yes, we make another loop. If the answer is no, then the loop is over.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?  
What happens if you create an infinite loop? Are there specific ways to avoid this?  
When is the `break` keyword used vs. just writing the loop to end at a specific place?  
Is there a practical limit on the size of an array that loops can be run on? The textbook mentioned that loops with many items can cause slow loading times.
